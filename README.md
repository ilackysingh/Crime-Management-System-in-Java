# Crime-Management-System-in-Java
A mini java project on Crime Management System in Java.


The CRIME_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM project is a software application developed as a graduation college project in 2019. The project is written in Java programming language and uses the Swing framework for the user interface. The backend of the system is based on text files, and there is no database integration.

The system aims to help manage crime-related data such as criminal records, case files, and police reports. It provides a user-friendly interface for law enforcement agencies to store, manage and retrieve crime-related data easily.

Some of the features of the CRIME_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM project include:

User authentication: The system requires users to log in with their credentials to access the system.

Criminal record management: The system allows the user to create, update and delete criminal records.

Case file management: The system allows the user to create, update and delete case files related to a criminal record.

Police report management: The system allows the user to create and manage police reports related to a case file.

In addition to the features mentioned earlier, the system also includes modules for managing information on most wanted criminals, lost items, and missing persons. It allows users to add new records, update existing records, and search for records based on different criteria.

The system also has a complaints module that allows citizens to file complaints related to crime, which can be tracked and managed by the law enforcement agency. The system also has modules for tracking citizen awards and police awards, which can be awarded based on different criteria such as outstanding service, bravery, and heroism.

The system also provides real-time updates on recent news related to crime and law enforcement activities, as well as hot news related to major crimes or incidents. It also provides information on upcoming holidays that may impact law enforcement activities.

In the future, the system is planned to be updated to use a database instead of text files for storing data, which will provide better scalability and performance.

Overall, the CRIME_MANAGEMENT_SYSTEM project is a comprehensive software application that provides a range of features to help law enforcement agencies manage crime-related data and activities efficiently.
